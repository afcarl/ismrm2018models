Models of diffusion MRI are mathematical expressions that describe the data, summarize it and approximate it. The values of the fit parameters are used to interpret the data in light of the structure of the tissue or its physical properties. The presentation will introduce a framework for model comparison using cross-validation: the model is fit to one part of the data and the model parameters are used to predict the signal in another part of the data. Cross-validation is used to assess parameter reliability, as well as accuracy of the model with respect to the data.
